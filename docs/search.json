In the course we explored how modern computational methods from the field of machine learning can aid us in forecasting and predicting future conflicts. The course gave me a solid foundation in machine learning, working with geographical data, and the theory behind conflict predition. In the sections below, I have written a brief summary of my final exam for the course. Feel free to explore the summary or take a look at the notebook that I handed in for the exam."

    "text": "In 2021 I wrote my master’s thesis in Political Science. In the thesis, I explored how elite polarization in parliamentary speeches has evolved over the pas decades by conducting a descriptive case study of parliamentary speeches in the Danish Parliament (Folketinget) from 1990 to 2020. To measure elite polarization, I relied on a novel approach that utilized the performance indicator of a supervised machine learning model to measure differences in political speech. In the sections below, I have summarized some of the findings of my thesis and my key learnings. Feel free to explore the summary or take a look at the complete thesis (the thesis is written in Danish)."

    "text": "My Data Science Journey\nI started on my data science journey during my master’s degree in political science, where I enrolled in an introductory course in social data science. This course introduced me to Python and sparked my interest in data science. From there on, I pursued additional courses related to data science. This included the course “Machine Learning in Conflict Prediction”, where I learned how modern computational methods from the field of machine learning can contribute to forecasting and predicting future conflicts. You can find more about this course in the github repository.\nFurthermore, I pursued a specialization in political behavior and advanced quantitative methods, where I developed my skills in conducting causal research through various methods such as experiments, instrumental variables, and differences-in-differences using the statistical software R. For more details, you can visit the course webpage, and see my assignment here.\nI applied these acquired skills in my thesis, where I investigated polarization in parliamentary speeches and legislative votes. I employed a machine learning-based measure of linguistic polarization among Danish politicians, working with unstructured data and large datasets comprising 0.5 million speeches. I also gained experience utilising Google Cloud Platform to run my machine learning models.\nLooking ahead, I have enrolled in a master’s degree program in data science starting September 2024. I am looking very much forward to learn tons of new things within the field of data science."
