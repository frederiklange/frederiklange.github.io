          I'm a data scientist with a background in political science. I have
          previously worked at the Danish Ministry of Finance. <br />
          From September 2024, I will be pursuing my passion for data science by
          enrolling in a master’s degree program at the University of Southern
          Denmark.

          <p>
            I started on my data science journey during my master’s degree in
            political science, where I enrolled in an introductory course in
            social data science. This course introduced me to Python and sparked
            my interest in data science. From there on, I pursued additional
            courses related to data science. This included the course “Machine
            Learning in Conflict Prediction”, where I learned how modern
            computational methods from the field of machine learning can
            contribute to forecasting and predicting future conflicts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, I pursued a specialization in political behavior and
            advanced quantitative methods, where I developed my skills in
            conducting causal research through various methods such as
            experiments, instrumental variables, and differences-in-differences
            using the statistical software R.
          </p>
          <p>
            I applied these skills in my thesis, where I investigated
            polarization in parliamentary speeches and legislative votes. I
            employed a machine learning-based measure of linguistic polarization
            among Danish politicians, working with unstructured data and large
            datasets comprising 0.5 million speeches. I also gained experience
            utilising Google Cloud Platform to run my machine learning models.

            During my master’s degree in political science I took a course
            called Machine Learning and Conflict Prediction. In the course we
            explored how modern computational methods from the field of machine
            learning can aid us in forecasting and predicting future conflicts.
            The course gave me a solid foundation in machine learning, working
            with geographical data, and the theory behind conflict prediction.

        <h2>PROJECT 2: Polarization in Parliamentary Speeches</h2>
        <div class="portfolio-card reverse">
          <p>
            In my master’s thesis in Political Science, I explored how elite
            polarization in parliamentary speeches has evolved over the past
            decades by conducting a descriptive case study of parliamentary
            speeches in the Danish Parliament from 1990 to 2020. To measure
            elite polarization, I relied on a novel approach that utilized the
            performance indicator of a supervised machine learning model to
            measure differences in political speech.
