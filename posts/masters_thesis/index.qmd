In 2021 I wrote my master's thesis in Political Science. In the thesis, I explored how elite polarization in parliamentary speeches has evolved over the pas decades by conducting a descriptive case study of parliamentary speeches in the Danish Parliament (Folketinget) from 1990 to 2020. To measure elite polarization, I relied on a novel approach that utilized the performance indicator of a supervised machine learning model to measure differences in political speech. In the sections below, I have summarized some of the findings of my thesis and my key learnings. Feel free to explore the summary or take a look at the complete [thesis](https://github.com/frederiklange/thesis_political_science/blob/main/niels_frederik_lange_speciale_september_2021.pdf) (the thesis is written in Danish).
