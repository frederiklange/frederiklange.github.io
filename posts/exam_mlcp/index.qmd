During my master's degree in political science I took a course called *Machine Learning and Conflict Prediction*. In the course we explored how modern computational methods from the field of machine learning can aid us in forecasting and predicting future conflicts. The course gave me a solid foundation in machine learning, working with geographical data, and the theory behind conflict predition. In the sections below, I have written a brief summary of my final exam for the course. Feel free to explore the summary or take a look at the [notebook](https://github.com/frederiklange/exam_mlcp/blob/main/exam_frederiklange.ipynb) that I handed in for the exam.

## Finding the Best Model for conflict prediction
Description of process leading up to this.

### Selecting a Subset of Features That Do Not Lower Performance
Arguments for selecting features. Process techically and theoretically-

### Hyperparameter Strategy: A Hands-on Grid-Search
Description of the process and strategy. Show example plots and refor to github page.

### Training and Tuning the Model
Description of process and show plots. Talk about the main metrics and strengths and weaknesses.

### Evaluating the Models After the Grid-Search
Talk about the grid-search. Why do two? Consider showing the code.

### Testing the Performance of the Selected Model
Talk about the role of testing and summarize findings. 

## Key Learnings and Reflections
Reflect on key learnings. Technical and theretical.
